SimpSniff
=========

Abstract
---------

This project intends to give basic introduction to network packet sniffers.

Thus, we will first try to recall some basic network concepts, as well as some standard protocols. Then, we will explain you the contexts in which sniffers evolve and we will mention several sniffing methods. Finally, we will demonstrate with SimpSniff, how libcap (a freely available library for capturing packets) can be used to write a small and efficient sniffing tool.

This project can be further easily scaled to support many other TCP/IP Network model based protocols like FTP, POP3 etc, or even to other network models like IPX, AppleTalk, etc.

The practical purpose of this project is to provide monitoring ability to the administrator of a network for various purposes like diagnosis of network usage, etc. This project can also be deployed at home PCs or laptops by users or parents to monitor the internet access.
